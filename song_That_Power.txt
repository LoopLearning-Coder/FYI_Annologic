[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And, oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And, oh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And, oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm lovin' every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power

[Chorus: will.i.am, will.i.am & Justin Bieber]
I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power, power, power

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
They call me Will-A, stay so cool, I'm chilly
I done made that milli' on my way to that billi'
Used to have a piggy bank, but now I got that bigger bank
Who-Who cares what the haters think?
They hatin' on me cause I'm doin' what they can't
I stay on that hustle, I flex that mental muscle
Hate to bust your bubble, I'm on that other level

[Refrain: will.i.am]
I'ma take it higher and high, high and higher
I stay in fly attire
Keep burnin' like that fire

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And, oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And, oh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And, oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm lovin' every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power

[Chorus: will.i.am, will.i.am & Justin Bieber]
I got that power
I got that power

Power, power, power

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Y-Y-Y-Yes, y'all, feelin' funky fresh, y'all
Work to be the best, y'all, work good under pressure
Been through all that stress, y'all, get-get this off my chest, y'all
Made it out them projects with this project, that's progress, y'all
I did it for my momma, I told her when I was younger
That I'ma be that number one, yup, I'll be that number one

[Refrain: will.i.am]
I take it higher and high, high and higher
I stay and buy attire
Keep burnin' like that fire (Fire, fire)


[Bridge: will.i.am]
Whatever doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
So I'ma get stronger
Comin' like a batterram, batterram
I'm knockin'-knockin' down the door again, door again
Comin'-comin' like a batterram, batterram
I'm knockin'-knockin' down the door again, door again

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And, oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And, oh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And, oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm lovin' every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power

[Chorus: will.i.am, will.i.am & Justin Bieber]
I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power, power, power

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
And I'm lovin' every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power
And I'm lovin' every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power
