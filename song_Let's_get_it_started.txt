[Verse 1: will.i.am; will.i.am & Fergie; will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Fergie]
In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break yo necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect
To lose this inhibition, follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Actin' up from north, west, east, south

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am, will.i.am & Fergie, All]
Everybody (Yeah), everybody (Yeah)
Let's get into it (Yeah), get stupid (Come on)
Get it started (Come on), get it started (Yeah)
Get it started

[Chorus: will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Fergie]

Let's get it started (Hah)

Lose control of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people, we'll walk you through it
Step by step like an infant new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'
