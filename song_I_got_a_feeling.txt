I got a feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling, woo-hoo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling, woo-hoo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (A feel-)

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie, will.i.am]
Tonight's the night
Let's live it up
I got my money
Let's spend it up (I feel-)
Go out and smash it
Like oh my God
Jump off that sofa
Let's kick it off (I feel-)
