[Chorus 1: Cody Wise]
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I'ma spend my money
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I'ma spend my money
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I'ma live my fantasy
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I'ma live my fantasy

[Verse 1: Cody Wise]
I'ma turn up, we can turn up
We can take it higher
We can burn up, we can burn up
Set this place on fire
Ooh, it's hot, ooh, it's hot
Damn, it's hot, ooh, baby
I won't stop, we won't stop
We gon' get real crazy

[Pre-Chorus 1: will.i.am]
I'ma spend a dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar
We gon' put it down, like we don't care-ah
I'ma throw my hands up in the air, the air, the ai-air
I'ma call you mama, mami call me papa
We gon' get down like you know what's up-ah
The world don't matter, your problem don't matter
'Cause we gon' get dumb, dumb dumb, dumb datta
Ayy

[Chorus 2: Cody Wise]
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I'ma spend my money
Pretty lady, pretty lady
You should be my honey

[Verse 2: Cody Wise]
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I'ma spend a dollar
Pretty lady, pretty lady
Won't you let me holler
Holler at you, holler at you
Won't you be my fantasy
Girl, I got you, girl, I got you
You look like my destiny
Mamacita, mamacita
Señorita, ven aquí
Que bonita, que bonita

Kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, I want your body
Come with me, come with me
Come with me, girl, let's go party


[Pre-Chorus 2: will.i.am]
I'ma get the dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar
Get it over there, and get it over there-ah
I'ma throw my hands up in the air, the air, in the ai-air
I'ma call you baby, baby, be my baby
We can burn it down, get down, and crazy
Time for drinks, no time to think
Let's do our thing, t-thing, t-t-thing

[Bridge: Cody Wise]
I'ma go spend some dollars
Go on and scream and holla
Put my hands in the air
Party like I don't care
Where the ladies? Where the girls?
It's a party, come with me
Pretty ladies around the world
It's a party, come with me

[Chorus 2: Cody Wise]
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I'ma spend my money
Pretty lady, pretty lady
You should be my honey
Lord ha' mercy, Lord ha' mercy
Pretty baby, come with me
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I'ma live my fantasy


[Outro: will.i.am]
Uh-oh
Here we go, here we go-o
Tell the people in the disco
Burn it down to the floo-oor
'Cause we don't care, ca-are, ca-are
We got our hands up in the ai-air
Everybody in the party
We party like it's everybody birthday, -day
